    <p>
      The Undergraduate Horticulture Society, also known as Hortus Forum, wants to cultivate a positive social community which fosters a passion for plants and teaches the value of horticulture. Hortus Forum has a key role in providing educational experiences beyond the classroom and teaching the Cornell community about plants. This includes but is not limited to: field trips, presentations and workshops, promotion of internships, career development opportunities, and social events. We strive to provide a forum for conversation with campus representatives, such as administrators. Representing plant science students to administration is not necessarily a priority, given the diversity of majors represented throughout the club. Lastly, we serve to promote plant sales which are a necessary function of the organization; they are a means of generating revenue, and are utilized as learning opportunities and outreach. Although plant sales primarily encompass ornamental plants, Hortus Forum represents the breadth of horticulture and includes opportunities for engaging with a diversity of plant-based experiences.
