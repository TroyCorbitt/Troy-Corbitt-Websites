[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Milestone 3 Team Feedback Revisions
> Explain what your **team** collectively revised in response to the Milestone 3 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

No revisions, since no feedback

## Collective Implementation
> Explain how your team **collectively** implemented sessions and user access controls. (1-2 sentences)
> If one person did not contribute, simply state that.

together we decided that users can not access admin insert, edit, and view all if theyre not logged in and therefore will use conditionals to restrict the viewing if not logged, and otherwise display the login form, and planned together to include sessions and users, making the admin user "Troy". Once logged in, the other pages will be visible to change between as well as a logout option for the admin, and then will only display consumer home and details pages.

## Grading: User Accounts
> The graders will need to log in to your website.
