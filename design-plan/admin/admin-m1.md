## _Cohesive_ Audience
> Briefly explain your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific.


Individuals working for music streaming services (like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc.) who are focused on curating playlists, managing artist relations, and enhancing user experience. They need to keep track of which songs are most popular to optimize their platform’s offerings and engage their user base effectively.

> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)
>
 These individuals curate playlists, manage artist relations, and strive to enhance user experience on platforms like YouTube Music.  This synergy between their role-specific needs and the site's offerings makes them a particularly relevant and engaged audience, as the data directly impacts their ability to optimize their platform's offerings and engage their user base more effectively.

## Audience Goals
> Document your **administrator** audience's goals.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need
> enough to do the job (Hint: It's at least 1, but probably no more than 3).

Goal 1: Optimize Playlist Curation - Utilize data on top-streamed songs to curate engaging and relevant playlists that cater to diverse listener preferences and emerging trends.

Goal 3: Improve User Experience - Analyze trends in music streaming to refine and personalize user interactions, with goals of retaining and expanding the user base.



## Persona
> Use the goals you identified to develop a persona of your site's **administrator** audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona.
> Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
