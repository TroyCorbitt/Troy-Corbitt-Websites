Wide Browser


### Grading: Step-by-Step Instructions
> Write step-by-step instructions for the graders.
>
> - This project can be hard to grade if we don't understand how your site works.
> - Include all steps. For example, if you must log in before you can delete an entry, say so.
> - For each set of instructions, assume the grader is starting from /

_**Consumer** view all entries:_

1. When you open this website, entries are listed, you don't need to do anything to view all entries

10. When the new song inserted, you can see it from the buttom of the `Admin View All` or `Consumer View all` page.


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment.
> How have you improved from projects 1 and 2?
> What would you do differently next time? (1-2 sentences)

From projects 1 and 2, I've greatly improved my ability to query databases, which has empowered me to construct more powerful and functional websites. Next time, I will integrate advanced database querying techniques from the beginning of the development process, which will improve site performance and enrich the user experience right from the start.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-2 sentences)

Since starting this class, I've made significant progress in understanding and applying complex web development concepts, from database management to user interface design. Reflecting on my journey, I'm truly proud of how much I've learned and the practical skills I've developed, which have transformed the way I approach building and optimizing websites.
